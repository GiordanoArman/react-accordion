# Styling

The unstyled `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components render the following HTML markups
into DOM.

<CodeBlock language="html">{skeleton}</CodeBlock>

Each tag has some global class selectors attached. Depending on the styling system in your
project, you may not use those class selectors.

Each tag accepts a `className` prop which can be used to append custom class selectors.
The `className` prop also supports a function form that receives relevant state as its
parameters.
